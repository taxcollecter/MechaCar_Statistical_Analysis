## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![MPG Analysis](https://github.com/taxcollecter/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/72bacb7f5d1c2fd8140ad587b97e28879dcbd969/Resources/Deliverable1.png)

-- Reviewing the output of the linear regression and the variables provided, we can see that Spoiler angle, AWD, and Vehicle Weight all provide a "non-random" amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

-- Based upon our p-value, the slope of our linear model is not zero. The value is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05% 

--While the model helps identify how the variables impact mpg, I do not believe it predicts mpg effectively. I believe there are other factors that will need to considered before we can confidently assess (Engine specs, fuel grade, etc.)
